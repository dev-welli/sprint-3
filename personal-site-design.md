What is you site's primary purpose?

    To showcase the journey undertaken as an EDA student to become a Front End Developer.


Who is your target audience?

    EDA instructors, other EDA students, current or potential future employers.


How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

    I want them to see an uncluttered site, easy to navigate to see information they seek about me as a person and as a developer.


How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

    Build it as a responsive website, beautiful experience in a small screen (mobile) and then adapt it to other/larger screen. Hopefully, I'll be able to implement what I've learned so far.
